    <h1>We cook and deliver rice noodles!</h1>
    <h2>Not noodles, but rice noodles!</h2>
    <h2>米线 Mixian</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rice noodles, or simply rice noodle, are noodles made from rice. The principal ingredients are rice flour and water. Sometimes ingredients such as tapioca or corn starch are added in order to improve the transparency or increase the gelatinous and chewy texture of the noodles. Rice noodles are most common in the cuisines of East, Southeast and South Asia. They are available fresh, frozen, or dried, in various shapes, thicknesses and textures. Fresh noodles are also highly perishable; their shelf life may be just several days.</p>

    <h2>3 Health Benefits of Rice Noodles</h2>
    <p>1. They’re Gluten-Free</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity, rice noodles will be your go-to. While gluten isn’t inherently unhealthy, Harvard Medical School reports than nearly 2 million Americans may have celiac disease, though only about 300,000 of them have been diagnosed. So, if you have a hunch you could be sensitive to wheat, rice noodles might be easier on your tummy.

    <p>2. They’re Rich in Manganese and Selenium</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manganese is a mineral that’s crucial in regulating blood sugar and reducing inflammation. A two-ounce serving of rice noodles boasts 14 percent of your daily recommended manganese. Rice noodles also contain 12 percent of your daily selenium, an antioxidant that can help lower your risk for cancer, heart disease and other chronic illnesses.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. They’re Rich in Phosphorus</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does this mineral assist your body in using and storing energy, but it also works alongside calcium to maintain tooth and bone health and helps the kidneys filter waste. Each two-ounce serving of rice noodles packs 87 milligrams of phosphorous, or about 9 percent of what you should have in a day.</p>
